Vaccinations and neutering are COMPULSORY for adoption. Succesful adopter will have to reimburse me for these procedures at which point i will hand over his medical booklet.

It's a miracle for me! Caty escaped through an open window into my back lane between the night of Friday, 25 May and the morning of Saturday, 26 May in Taman Tun Dr Ismail, KL.

This would probably be my last batch of kittens since I would finally want to spay my cat after this. I would like to keep them, but my current circumstances does allow me to so I'm hoping to find interested pet lovers. This one is called Pepa or Pepper, another spice name. She's pretty chill kitten, doesn't run around much, but is pretty friendly and likes to play with her 'twin', Orey. The difference between her and Orey is she has brownish color on her legs. Orey can already eat wet food and a bit of dried food, so food wise, it shouldn't be too much of a problem. If you can, maybe get one pack of kitten milk and feed her that until it finishes. I'm currently training her and her siblings to use the litter box and it seems that they know where to do their business now so that's good. If interested in one, or more of them, please call/sms me at or email me. Unfortunately I don't have whatsapp, but if you need any additional pictures to be sent, please let me know your emails and I'll send them over.</td>\n",

       "      <td>/12 - first vet visit for overall examination. Clear except for dirty ears, cleaned out by vet and appplied ear drops. /12 - dewormed. ---------------------------- This kitten appeared at my gate this morning as I was going out! Very friendly, approached me and then I took him in. He is tame, clean and appears very healthy. I gave him a good bath (no fleas) and cleaned its ears and administered ear drops. Jonker has found his favourite spot, under the computer table in a tiny tub meant for waste paper! He is very manageable and adorable. Litter trained and allowed to roam freely around the house. Now feeding on RC weaning kibbles, eating normally. Sorry the pics are not so clear, my digital camera kaput, so have to take the shots with my Nokia handphone. :( Please send me a text message and I'll reply asap I am staying in USJ11, UEP Subang Jaya. Thanks for viewing his profile.</td>\n",

It would be great if someone could take both together as they are very close - they sleep and play together. Nala is smaller but more manja, she will fall asleep on my lap when she is tired. Simba is a little bit bigger but more shy. He will follow whatever his sister does. They both run around and play and have adapted very well to life indoors. Pls sms or email if interested. I am feeding them kitten wet food, kitten kibble and kitten milk and are learning to use the litter tray and will be sending deworming them this week. They have been bathed and treated for fleas but adopter should continue frontline/flea treatment to ensure the flea cycle is stopped. Adopters MUST spay/neuter the kittens once they reach appropriate age.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This is Bubu. He was found in my residential college (Gombak) alone with no siblings or mom in sight. He frequented my room and my neighbours' rooms and we cared for him as much as we could. Bubu has a wound near his mouth (the vet suspected it was from either an insect bite or a kitten fight) and we are currently treating him with antibiotic pills and dressings. All of us have graduated and are heading back to our hometowns. We would like to put Bubu up for adoption and would preferably look for an adopter who is: 1. Willing to treat his wound. (it's healing well and has dried up, just need to finish what is left of his antibiotic) 2. Must send him to his second injection for ear mites. 3. Must vaccine him. 4. Will preferably neuter him when he is of age. Bubu is affectionate (he's the purr-er type), playful, loving and beautiful (look at that fur! Its super soft as well). He has a bob tail which makes him even more special. 💙❤️ Please help share this around. We really want him to find someone who can love and care for him as much as (or better than) we did. If you are interested, please PM me or drop a comment below so I can reach out to you. The RM50 is to cover the medication cost of the treatment of the small wound near his whiskers (due to a kitten fight or an insect bite as mentioned by the vet) as well as a deposit to ensure that the cat is properly cared for as the abovementioned requirement.</td>\n",

He is a soft and gentle natured dog who suffers from mild epilepsy (infrequent fits), but is not medicated. He is great with our young children and is a big softie who loves cuddles. Zorro (Tri-colored Harrier) is an 11 year old male. He is a lovable and independent dog, also great with our young children. Both dogs are well behaved, don't bark or whine and are extremely good-natured. They are used to being outdoors and due to their size, they need space to run around. Tank and Zorro are best friends and need to stay together. We would like to find a new loving home for them both to remain together. We are due to move very soon so would encourage any interested parties to make contact as soon as possible to arrange an adoption interview.</td>\n",

We are foreigner from India and we already have a dog which we adopted last year. It is impossible for us to maintain another cat in home as we may have to leave Malaysia anytime. We do not have the financial support to carry both the pets to India. We can take the dog only. I request some kind hearted person to take care of this kitten.

       "0     She is a very manja cat and do love attention. It just that due to new work and my sis being sick. I need to reduce the amount of cats in my house. She have been staying outdoor. She has been litter train. She loves to ride cars. You can bring her for a tour. She is gentle. I thought she was a male before this. But eventually she got pregnant and give birth to 5 healthy kittens. She likes to stay indoor. But due to my sis condition, we can't have my cats indoor. I want her to find a new good home. If you want me to spay her before adoption, we can discuss about it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "1     I found this cat crying outside my house in the neighbour's yard, hiding under some bushes. After I called the cat, he came running to me so there's a possibility he might have been owned before or he's used to people feeding him. No collar, no microchip. He's not shy at all and very responsive. He has a wound on his leg and the vet said it's due to a fight he had with another tom cat. The cat is at the vet and he'll be spayed. He's not the neighbour's cat, I've already asked. He is available for adoption by Friday (/) if no one claims him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "9     Hi, saya sedang mencari mereka yang sudi adopt kucing yang saya temui di kedai berhampiran dengan kawasan perumahan saya. Sementara ini, saya menamakannya 'Chopper'. Dia sangat aktif bermain bola loceng, toilet trained, makan friskies & whiskas, senang dimandikan & tak kacau barang dalam rumah. Sesiapa yang berminat dengan kucingi ni, sila hubungi saya sebelum 7 Feb kerana saya outstation pada 8 Feb.

       "17    Arya and Luna are sisters. Yin and Yang. They complement each others personalities beautifully. Luna the tabby (or looney Luna as I call her) is gregarious, playful and loving. Not to mention an attention seeker. Arya, the black one, is more gentle and loving (and I bet observes her sister while shaking her head). They are both attached at the hip, really Ideally, I would like them to be adopted together, but failing that, hoping a caring loving home would be provided for these two rascals. The first vaccination and deworming has already been paid for by their rescuer. He has also been kind enough to pay in advance for their second round of vaccinations next month.

       "18    Found wandering around my friend's apartment complex. He was bullied and thrown around by some of the resident children. In spite of this he bears no ill-will toward people. He is frisky, playful, and affectionate. On his first day with us he willingly sat on our laps and settled down for a comfortable and cosy nap. This little guy will do well in a home with another playful cat. Tuna is an INDOOR cat. The outside world is dangerous, and he has already suffered at the hands of ignorant people. Zero to minimal cage confinement please. This kitten is very playful and energetic and needs lots of space to run around. Keeping him in a cage would be cruel. Vaccinations and neutering are COMPULSORY for adoption. Succesful adopter will have to reimburse me for these procedures at which point i will hand over his medical booklet. Adopter must also update me from time to time about tuna's progress.

       "20    26 May update: Caty has been found! And by SPain my dog who noticed something under the neighbor's car right outside my home. I had to coax her out because she was frightened by SPain's barking. Somehow, she traveled from my back lane to the front and knew where my house is despite never being out before. It's a miracle for me! Caty escaped through an open window into my back lane between the night of Friday, 25 May and the morning of Saturday, 26 May in Taman Tun Dr Ismail, KL. She is very easily recognisable as: 1) she's missing a left eye, 2) her right ear is v-notched and 3) she's wearing a purple collar and bell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "21    Hi, I have another adult female cat who had babies. They're all about 6 weeks old now so they should be able to be given away. This would probably be my last batch of kittens since I would finally want to spay my cat after this. I would like to keep them, but my current circumstances does allow me to so I'm hoping to find interested pet lovers. This one is called Pepa or Pepper, another spice name. She's pretty chill kitten, doesn't run around much, but is pretty friendly and likes to play with her 'twin', Orey. The difference between her and Orey is she has brownish color on her legs. Orey can already eat wet food and a bit of dried food, so food wise, it shouldn't be too much of a problem. If you can, maybe get one pack of kitten milk and feed her that until it finishes. I'm currently training her and her siblings to use the litter box and it seems that they know where to do their business now so that's good. If interested in one, or more of them, please call/sms me at or email me. Unfortunately I don't have whatsapp, but if you need any additional pictures to be sent, please let me know your emails and I'll send them over.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "22    Tumbles is a cuddly, playful, joy-filled kitten who will light up your life with love. She purrs constantly, comes to her name, and hops like a bunny on her toys. She’s adorable! When she was just a tiny baby, this blue-eyed angel was almost killed by a mean person who threw her out the window of a moving car, but she was saved in the nick of time before an oncoming car almost ran her over. She is so grateful to have a second chance at life. Now she needs a kind person to adopt her. Tumbles has so much love to give! She will provide you with endless happiness, entertainment, and fun. She’s been vaccinated, de-wormed, and is healthy and flea-free. She's also litter box trained! Included in the adoption is a FREE supply of kitten food, litter pan, bedding, toys and kitty litter. Tumbles is just waiting for you to take her home so she can love you. Adopting her will be the best decision of your life. She's a real sweetie! :-)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "23    Looking for a GOOD home for our friendly family cat. He’s a 2-year old spayed male, ginger tabby.

Clear except for dirty ears, cleaned out by vet and appplied ear drops. /12 - dewormed. ---------------------------- This kitten appeared at my gate this morning as I was going out! Very friendly, approached me and then I took him in. He is tame, clean and appears very healthy. I gave him a good bath (no fleas) and cleaned its ears and administered ear drops. Jonker has found his favourite spot, under the computer table in a tiny tub meant for waste paper! He is very manageable and adorable. Litter trained and allowed to roam freely around the house. Now feeding on RC weaning kibbles, eating normally.

       "28    These ginger tabby kittens were rescued from the rain two days ago. They are about 4-5 weeks old, healthy and active. It would be great if someone could take both together as they are very close - they sleep and play together. Nala is smaller but more manja, she will fall asleep on my lap when she is tired. Simba is a little bit bigger but more shy. He will follow whatever his sister does. They both run around and play and have adapted very well to life indoors. Pls sms or email if interested. I am feeding them kitten wet food, kitten kibble and kitten milk and are learning to use the litter tray and will be sending deworming them this week. They have been bathed and treated for fleas but adopter should continue frontline/flea treatment to ensure the flea cycle is stopped. Adopters MUST spay/neuter the kittens once they reach appropriate age.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "29    This is Bubu. He was found in my residential college (Gombak) alone with no siblings or mom in sight. He frequented my room and my neighbours' rooms and we cared for him as much as we could. Bubu has a wound near his mouth (the vet suspected it was from either an insect bite or a kitten fight) and we are currently treating him with antibiotic pills and dressings. All of us have graduated and are heading back to our hometowns. We would like to put Bubu up for adoption and would preferably look for an adopter who is: 1. Willing to treat his wound. (it's healing well and has dried up, just need to finish what is left of his antibiotic) 2. Must send him to his second injection for ear mites. 3. Must vaccine him. 4. Will preferably neuter him when he is of age. Bubu is affectionate (he's the purr-er type), playful, loving and beautiful (look at that fur! Its super soft as well). He has a bob tail which makes him even more special. 💙❤️ Please help share this around. We really want him to find someone who can love and care for him as much as (or better than) we did. If you are interested, please PM me or drop a comment below so I can reach out to you. The RM50 is to cover the medication cost of the treatment of the small wound near his whiskers (due to a kitten fight or an insect bite as mentioned by the vet) as well as a deposit to ensure that the cat is properly cared for as the abovementioned requirement.   \n",

       "4194  Found these two near Mahkota Cheras, surely Home dogs but were in bad condition of fur and hungry when found. No one near the neighbourhood came forward claiming them. We then sent them for full grooming. TWO rescued furkids are now back from their grooming & looking stunning now. One is % a Shar Pei and the other is either a Samoyed / Golden Retriever. We had to shave off the Golden/Samoyed's fur as it was in bad condition, but now looks great!! We need help to have them adopted as our two resident furkids are feeling insecured and restless with them around. Both of them are extremely Friendly and Loving and are both very attached to one another. Estimated age is 3/4 years. Genuine Adoption ONLY.

       "4198  Our two adult dogs are available for adoption (as a pair). They have been with our family for ten years and we are heartbroken to have to give them up. Unfortunately we are required to move for work and cannot take them with us. Tank (Golden Labrador) is a 10 year old male. He is a soft and gentle natured dog who suffers from mild epilepsy (infrequent fits), but is not medicated. He is great with our young children and is a big softie who loves cuddles. Zorro (Tri-colored Harrier) is an 11 year old male. He is a lovable and independent dog, also great with our young children. Both dogs are well behaved, don't bark or whine and are extremely good-natured. They are used to being outdoors and due to their size, they need space to run around. Tank and Zorro are best friends and need to stay together. We would like to find a new loving home for them both to remain together. We are due to move very soon so would encourage any interested parties to make contact as soon as possible to arrange an adoption interview.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "4211  Yesterday we were just walking to the grocery & suddenly we heard a feeble meow from a distance. Being an animal lover both my wife and me immediately recognized that the meow was of a kitten in distress. Following the voice we continued to walk and suddenly found a cute little grey kitten crawling on the road with full of cars. We took it immediately and she was shivering in my hands. We are foreigner from India and we already have a dog which we adopted last year. It is impossible for us to maintain another cat in home as we may have to leave Malaysia anytime. We do not have the financial support to carry both the pets to India. We can take the dog only. I request some kind hearted person to take care of this kitten. She is very playful and is able to drink milk by herself from a pot we provided. We will need some financial support too to deworm & neuter the kitten. Please come forward for help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

Can be nervous but adapts to new environments quite easily. Has a good appetite and is friendly. Is litter box trained. She socialises easily with humans and other cats.

They will be up for adoption on 1st April (about 9 weeks old). Anyone interested can contact me for pre-booking. This will also provide you some time to do the preparation before this two cute kitten come to your lovely home. I only prefer cat lover, if possible want them to be adopted as pair. Because I love to see them both together and they are very attached to each other. Very playful and healthy. Due to limited space, this two baby is open for adoption because currently I have 16 cats at home. These cute baby should be an INDOOR cat only (I never let any of my cat out before, so they have not been expose to outdoor). Very sad to let them go actually~ Currently they are on Royal Canin Mother &amp; babycat for kitten 4 months and below.</td>\n",

My two kids are also confirmed to have some allergies hence cannot play with her for long. Its sad for me to let her go but I am hoping a kind family looking for a beautiful loving dog would consider having Chloe in their home.</td>\n",

When we rescued him and took him to the vet, he was fairly healthy, apart from a few minor injuries and fleas. He has recovered since and his coat is slowly growing back. He's a happy and lovable dog. Although generally very docile and obedient, he's an active and playful puppy that would always look forward to feeding time and play time He has made friends with another stray puppy that is under my care and they frequently run around the compound chasing each other and keeping themselves occupied for hours through the day. On chilly rainy days or cool humid nights, they share a cozy cage together to huddle up close or to sleep. He has a very good appetite and is always chewing on rawhide. He's a loyal companion, always gentle, yet watchful and observant. He has come a long way from being an frightened and abandoned stray pup that was trapped in a watery hole for several days without food and clean water to a puppy that is full of life and love in his eyes and heart. We hope that lovable Choco Pop finds a good home with caring owners.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Our two adult dogs are available for adoption (as a pair). They have been with our family for ten years and we are heartbroken to have to give them up. Unfortunately we are required to move for work and cannot take them with us. Tank (Golden Labrador) is a 10 year old male. He is a soft and gentle natured dog who suffers from mild epilepsy (infrequent fits), but is not medicated. He is great with our young children and is a big softie who loves cuddles. Zorro (Tri-colored Harrier) is an 11 year old male. He is a lovable and independent dog, also great with our young children. Both dogs are well behaved, don't bark or whine and are extremely good-natured. They are used to being outdoors and due to their size, they need space to run around. Tank and Zorro are best friends and need to stay together. We would like to find a new loving home for them both to remain together. We are due to move very soon so would encourage any interested parties to make contact as soon as possible to arrange an adoption interview.</td>\n",

       "1     Ogen (male) & Oyen (female) are about 2 months old. They were born on 17th Jan and 23rd Jan respectively. Yes they both are from separate mother. They will be up for adoption on 1st April (about 9 weeks old). Anyone interested can contact me for pre-booking. This will also provide you some time to do the preparation before this two cute kitten come to your lovely home. I only prefer cat lover, if possible want them to be adopted as pair. Because I love to see them both together and they are very attached to each other. Very playful and healthy. Due to limited space, this two baby is open for adoption because currently I have 16 cats at home. These cute baby should be an INDOOR cat only (I never let any of my cat out before, so they have not been expose to outdoor). Very sad to let them go actually~ Currently they are on Royal Canin Mother & babycat for kitten 4 months and below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

She is lovely and can be grown to be a good guard dog and a lovely companion. She may bring you the adopter good luck.

       "1341  We have had Chloe since she was a puppy. She has been lovingly cared for and loves children. There is not an ounce of aggressiveness in her. Loves walks and will sit and wait for her food. I have taken a job overseas and my wife is not able to care for her with my two kids and a mother with alzheimers. My two kids are also confirmed to have some allergies hence cannot play with her for long. Its sad for me to let her go but I am hoping a kind family looking for a beautiful loving dog would consider having Chloe in their home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "1343  We found Choco pop trapped in a manhole. He had fallen in several days earlier through one of the drain holes. When we rescued him and took him to the vet, he was fairly healthy, apart from a few minor injuries and fleas. He has recovered since and his coat is slowly growing back. He's a happy and lovable dog. Although generally very docile and obedient, he's an active and playful puppy that would always look forward to feeding time and play time He has made friends with another stray puppy that is under my care and they frequently run around the compound chasing each other and keeping themselves occupied for hours through the day. On chilly rainy days or cool humid nights, they share a cozy cage together to huddle up close or to sleep. He has a very good appetite and is always chewing on rawhide. He's a loyal companion, always gentle, yet watchful and observant. He has come a long way from being an frightened and abandoned stray pup that was trapped in a watery hole for several days without food and clean water to a puppy that is full of life and love in his eyes and heart. We hope that lovable Choco Pop finds a good home with caring owners.   \n",

       "1355  Our two adult dogs are available for adoption (as a pair). They have been with our family for ten years and we are heartbroken to have to give them up. Unfortunately we are required to move for work and cannot take them with us. Tank (Golden Labrador) is a 10 year old male. He is a soft and gentle natured dog who suffers from mild epilepsy (infrequent fits), but is not medicated. He is great with our young children and is a big softie who loves cuddles. Zorro (Tri-colored Harrier) is an 11 year old male. He is a lovable and independent dog, also great with our young children. Both dogs are well behaved, don't bark or whine and are extremely good-natured. They are used to being outdoors and due to their size, they need space to run around. Tank and Zorro are best friends and need to stay together. We would like to find a new loving home for them both to remain together. We are due to move very soon so would encourage any interested parties to make contact as soon as possible to arrange an adoption interview.                                                                                                                                             \n",
